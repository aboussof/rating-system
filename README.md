# rating-system
JQuery HTML5 rating system 1.0

Feel free to use it. 

# DOCUMENTATION
 If you want more stars just add a new Span:
 
    <span id="rat-6" name="rat" class="glyphicon glyphicon-star-empty rating"></span>
 
 and not forget to update the id!

 The vote result is stored on the hidden input field with the id 'rat-value'. So if you want to get the result just call the value
 of this field.

 If you have questions, critics or optimization ideas please do not hesitate to contact me here in GITHUB 
 or per Mail: aboussof.a@gmail.com
